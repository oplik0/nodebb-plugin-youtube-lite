# NodeBB Youtube Embed Plugin

The Youtube Embed plugin allows users to embed Youtube videos into NodeBB posts. Simply add the
link to the video on its own line.

In order to get title and duration information, the plugin needs to be configured with an API
key. See here for details on acquiring one:
